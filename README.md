# eliloconfig
Script allowing to manage EFI booting on derivatives of Slackware®.

This script is a modification of a the version initially written by Patrick Volkerding, Sebeka, Minnesota, USA who remains its copyright holder.

It adds to the version shipped in Slackware internationalization through gettext and an elilo boot menu with additional information accessible from the menu through display of text files.
